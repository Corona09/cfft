# What is CFFT #
CFFT, Create File From Templates, just like its name -- it lets you create files using certain existed templates.

CFFT works in terminal. It has a curses UI. 

# How to Use #

I don't know either, because actually CFFT is just at beginning.

# Source Code #
The source code is consists of 3 main files: main.c, cf.c, utils.c
and 2 headers cf.h and utils.h which contains the prototypes of functions
in cf.c and utils.c.

## main.c ##
Main working flow for cfft.

## cf.c ##
Some functions related to file operations.

And there are some important struct defined in cf.h
